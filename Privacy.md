# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [29 Jan 2026]

This Privacy Policy describes how Yukihana ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and stores information when you use our Discord music bot application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your data.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the minimum amount of data required to provide our music and playlist services. This data includes:

### User Data
* **Discord User ID:** Used to identify your unique account, link your premium status, and manage your playlists.
* **Listening History:** A list of tracks you have recently played (if history is enabled).
* **Favorites:** A list of tracks you have explicitly marked as favorites.
* **Spotify Profile:** Your Spotify profile URL if you choose to link it.
* **Playlists:** Custom playlists created by you, including playlist names, track data, and collaborator IDs.

### Server (Guild) Data
* **Guild ID:** Used to save server-specific settings.
* **Configuration:** Custom prefixes, default volume settings, 24/7 mode status, and ignored channels.
* **Queues:** The current music queue state is stored temporarily to persist playback across sessions.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
* **Core Functionality:** To play music, manage queues, and store your custom playlists.
* **Personalization:** To maintain your listening history and favorites list.
* **Premium Features:** To verify and maintain subscription status for premium tiers.
* **Session Management:** To restore your volume settings and voice channel connection state (e.g., 24/7 mode).

## 3. Data Control and Your Rights

You have full control over your data directly through the bot's interface. Using the `/privacy` command, you can:

* **Toggle History:** You may enable or disable the tracking of your listening history at any time.
* **Visibility:** You may toggle the visibility of your Spotify profile between Public and Private.
* **Deletion:** You can permanently clear your listening history and favorites list.
* **Playlists:** You can create, edit, or delete your custom playlists and remove collaborators.

## 4. Data Retention

* **Persistent Data:** User settings, playlists, favorites, and history are stored until you manually delete them or request data deletion.
* **Session Data:** Temporary session data (such as active queues) may be cleared periodically or upon bot restarts.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. Data is strictly used for the internal operation of the Yukihana bot.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request full data deletion, please contact the bot developers via our support server.
